# OpenAI x ExpressJS template

Practice starting a Typescript ExpressJS project from scratch. Created some basic API calls to OpenAI's API.

## Prerequisites

- Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
- Install nodemon globally via `npm install -g nodemon`

## Getting started

Create an `.env` file with the following:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=XXXXXXX
```

Create a new key here: [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

## Running the project

In VSCode, press `F5` to run the project with debugging. Or, run the following:

```bash
npm run dev
```
